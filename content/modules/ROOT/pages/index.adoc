**What this demo covers**

This demonstration shows why Red Hat OpenShift is more than container management. While any Kubernetes distribution can orchestrate containers, OpenShift delivers a complete application platform above the Kubernetes API: integrated development environments, automated CI/CD, a trusted software supply chain, a developer portal with self-service, and AI-ready application delivery. Through the Parasol Insurance scenario, presenters walk customers through the full platform story in three progressive sections, from foundational capabilities to advanced developer services to intelligent applications.

**Preparation**

* xref:01-overview.adoc[Overview and presenter preparation]
* xref:02-details.adoc[Environment details and setup]

**Section 1: Foundational application platform**

Establish the core value of OpenShift as an application platform. Application modernization, standardized development with DevSpaces, Quarkus dev mode, Tekton pipelines with quality enforcement, Argo CD delivery, and platform operations with Service Mesh and observability.

* xref:03-module-01-developer-experience.adoc[Module 1: Developer experience] — MTA migration context, one-click DevSpaces from the topology view, Quarkus dev mode, and platform engineer governance
* xref:04-module-02-cicd-pipeline.adoc[Module 2: CI/CD pipeline] — Tekton pipeline triggering, SAST/Sonarqube quality gates, AI-assisted test generation, and GitOps delivery with Argo CD
* xref:05-module-03-platform-operations.adoc[Module 3: Platform operations] — Traffic management and mTLS with Service Mesh, real-time observability with the Service Mesh console, and broader platform capabilities

**Section 2: Advanced developer services**

Move from "good to great." Red Hat Developer Hub as the single pane of glass for catalog, self-service, pipelines, and deployment status. Secure software factory with ACS scanning, Tekton Chains signing, SBOM generation, admission control, and Vault for secrets management.

* xref:06-module-04-developer-hub.adoc[Module 4: Developer Hub and catalog] — Developer Lightspeed for MTA, RHDH catalog exploration with AI-powered Q&A, and self-service environment and component provisioning
* xref:07-module-05-secure-development.adoc[Module 5: Secure development workflow] — Dependency Analytics in DevSpaces, secure build pipeline with signing and attestation, and external secrets with Vault
* xref:08-module-06-supply-chain.adoc[Module 6: Trusted software supply chain] — Production deployment with admission control, SBOM management with TPA, and application topology

**Section 3: Intelligent applications**

Show that AI-enhanced applications follow the same golden path. Developers consume LLM endpoints served by Red Hat AI, process business data from Kafka (Red Hat AMQ Streams), and deploy through the same trusted pipeline.

* xref:09-module-07-ai-applications.adoc[Module 7: AI-enhanced applications] — Building an AI-powered email routing service with DevHub templates, LLM integration, Kafka data processing, and trusted delivery

**Target audience**

Sales engineers, solution architects, and technical sellers positioning OpenShift as a complete application platform to customers evaluating container management, application modernization, or developer platform strategies.

**Demo duration**

Each section is approximately 45 minutes (15 minutes per module). Sections can be presented independently or combined. Section 1 establishes the foundation, Section 2 demonstrates the "good to great" progression, and Section 3 adds the intelligent applications story.
