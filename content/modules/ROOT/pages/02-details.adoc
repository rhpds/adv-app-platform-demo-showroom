== Demo application

The demo application is the **Parasol Insurance** web application, a Quarkus-based microservices application that handles policy management, claims processing, and customer interactions. Parasol migrated this application from a legacy Java EE platform to Quarkus on OpenShift using the Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA). The application is pre-deployed in the environment and serves as the foundation for all demo sections.

In Section 2, the application and all its components are registered in the Red Hat Developer Hub catalog as a "system" with linked components (frontend, backend, Kafka, database).

In Section 3, the application is extended with an AI-enhanced component that consumes an existing LLM endpoint and processes business data from Kafka.

== Pre-demo checklist

=== Section 1

. Log into the OpenShift console at {console_url} and confirm you can access the Developer perspective
. Open Dev Spaces at {devspaces_url} and confirm the dashboard loads
. Verify the Parasol application is running and accessible
. Open Argo CD at {argocd_url} and confirm the application sync status shows healthy
. Open a browser tab to Gitea at {gitea_url} and confirm repository access
. Verify the Tekton pipeline is visible in the OpenShift console under Pipelines
. Open Kiali at {kiali_url} and confirm the service graph loads
. Verify DevSpaces AI code assistance is enabled and functional

=== Section 2 (in addition to Section 1)

. Open Red Hat Developer Hub at {rhdh_url} and confirm the catalog loads
. Verify the Parasol system and its components are registered in the catalog
. Confirm software templates are available in the "Create" section
. Open ACS at {acs_url} and confirm the dashboard loads
. Open TPA at {tpa_url} and confirm SBOM data is visible
. Verify Vault is accessible at {vault_url} with Parasol secrets configured
. Open GitLab at {gitlab_url} and confirm repository access

=== Section 3 (in addition to Sections 1-2)

. Verify the LLM endpoint is serving and accessible
. Confirm the Kafka topic with business data is available and producing messages
. Verify the AI component template is available in RHDH

[TIP]
====
**Presenter tip:** Open all the URLs in separate browser tabs before starting. This avoids waiting for pages to load during the live demo. For Section 2, consider pre-loading the pipeline view and ACS dashboard. For Section 3, verify the LLM endpoint is responding before starting.
